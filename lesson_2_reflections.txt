What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    The .git-document is made and the information about the different versions can be stored in it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    It is different becasue it does not contain all the files. It gives us the opportunity to choose, which files should
    be stored in one commit.
