When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    If there is a project that I need access to from different computers, that i need help of other people for or 
    that i work on with other people together. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    In case the repository is changed by other people working on the same project I want to have control about the changes that 
    will be applied to my part of the project.
